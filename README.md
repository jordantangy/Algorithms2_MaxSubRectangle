# Algorithms2_MaxSubRectangle


To run the code, create a main function.
You input should be a matrix of length 3 : 
First column for i, second for j and third for value.
Example of input : 

int arr[][] = {{0,3,1},
               {1,2,1},
               {1,3,2},
               {1,4,-4},
               {2,1,2},
               {2,2,-3},
               {2,3,3},
               {2,4,3},
               {2,5,1},
               {3,0,-2},
               {3,1,10},
               {3,2,9},
               {3,3,-2},
               {3,4,4},
               {3,5,5},
               {3,6,-11}};
               
This matrix represents a given area in the matrix. For example, the first line of arr means that at emplacement [0][3], we have the value 1 ans so on.
To run the code , in main function :

MaxSubRectangle m = new MaxSubRectangle(arr);

Enjoy :)
